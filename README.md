# Multi-User Dungeon Engine

The goal of this project is to create a commercial-quality multi-user dungeon (MUD) engine that is flexible enough to be used as either a conventional MUD or an interactive fiction game.

The current implementation includes an SSH server for secure authentication and communication between the player and the server. The engine is primarily written in Go. Additionally, there is a user management system stub written in JavaScript and various utility scripts written in Python.

## Project Overview

The engine is primarily written in Go (version 1.22) with an SSH server for secure authentication and communication between the player and the server. Additionally, there are database utility scripts written in Python (version 3.12) and various deployment scripts.

Key components:

- Go server (v1.22) for game logic and player interactions
- Python (v3.12) scripts for database management and deployment
- AWS services for database (DynamoDB) and Identity Provider (Cognito)
- CloudFormation templates for AWS resource management

## Deployment

Deploying the server involves several steps:

1. Ensure you have Go 1.22 and Python 3.12 installed.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements/scripts-requirements.txt
   ```
4. Set up your AWS credentials (access key ID and secret access key) in your environment variables or AWS credentials file.
5. Run the deployment script:
   ```
   python scripts/deploy.py
   ```
   This script will create the necessary AWS resources using CloudFormation.
6. Once deployment is complete, build and run the server:
   ```
   go build ./ssh_server
   ./ssh_server
   ```

## Development

- The `core/` directory contains the main game logic and types.
- The `ssh_server/` directory contains the main server implementation.
- The `database/` directory contains Python scripts for database management.
- The `scripts/` directory contains deployment and utility scripts.
