**Notes:**

- All tables are designed for use with Amazon DynamoDB.
- Primary keys are specified for each table to ensure data integrity.
- Data types correspond to DynamoDB data types (e.g., `STRING`, `NUMBER`, `MAP`, `LIST`, `BOOLEAN`).
- Maps (`MAP`) and lists (`LIST`) are used to store complex data structures.
- UUIDs are stored as strings to maintain consistency and readability.
- Ensure that any secondary indexes needed for queries are properly configured in DynamoDB.
- Field names in code (e.g., struct tags) should match the attribute names in DynamoDB for seamless data mapping.

**Schema Overview:**

This schema supports a multi-user dungeon (MUD) game, providing structures for players, characters, rooms, items, and game messages. It facilitates:

- Player management with associated characters and messages seen.
- Character progression with attributes, abilities, inventory, and location tracking.
- Room definitions with descriptions, items, and exits to other rooms.
- Item management including stacking, containment, and usage mechanics.
- Archetype templates for character creation.
- Storage of messages of the day for player engagement.

By adhering to this schema, developers can ensure data consistency and ease of access across the application, while leveraging DynamoDB's capabilities for scalability and performance.
