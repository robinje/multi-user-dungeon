# Eidolon Engine Architecture

## Overview

The Eidolon Engine is a serverless multi-user game system built on AWS infrastructure, supporting both traditional MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) gameplay and incremental story-driven progression. The system uses a fully serverless architecture with DynamoDB for state persistence, Lambda for compute, and EventBridge for scheduled operations.

### Infrastructure Components

**AWS Services:**

- **12 CloudFormation Stacks** (`cf/eidolon-*.yml`, orchestrated by `scripts/eidolon_deployment.py`; see [Deployment Guide](deployment.md#system-architecture))
- **3 Deployment Modes**: MUD, Incremental, Hybrid (default)
- **Lambda Functions** (Python 3.12):
  - API Layer: character, archetype, item, store, story, and segment endpoints
  - Operational Layer: 3 functions (polling, processing, advancement)
  - Cognito Layer: player creation and deletion triggers
- **15 DynamoDB Tables**: All with deletion protection enabled
- **2 SQS Queues**: Processing and advancement queues
- **1 EventBridge Rule**: 1-minute polling for segment completion

**Key Design Principles:**

- **Fixed Logical IDs**: Preventing resource recreation on updates
- **Server-Side Authority**: All game state in DynamoDB, no client-side state
- **Front-Loaded Processing**: Outcomes calculated at segment start, not completion
- **Automatic Recovery**: Multiple cleanup paths for failure scenarios
- **Account Isolation**: Separate AWS accounts per environment (dev/staging/prod)

## Core Subsystems

### 1. Incremental Story System

The incremental subsystem provides timer-based story progression with narrative gameplay.

**Processing Architecture:**

1. **Segment Creation**: When a story starts or advances, outcomes are immediately calculated
2. **Timer Management**: Segments have start/end times for client countdown display
3. **Polling System**: EventBridge triggers every minute to find completed segments
4. **Dual Queue Processing**:
   - Segment Processing Queue: Mechanical segments processed immediately when created
   - Story Advancement Queue: All segments processed when timer expires
5. **Result Application**: Pre-calculated outcomes applied and story advanced

**Segment Types:**

- **Mechanical Segments**: Skill challenges and/or combat, processed immediately via SQS
- **Decision Segments**: Player choices with optional weighted timeout branching

**Key Features:**

- Front-loaded outcome calculation for predictable client experience
- Weighted random branching with prerequisite gating
- Flexible narrative branching (any outcome can lead to any path)
- Automatic timeout recovery protects players from system failures

### 2. Database Schema

**15 DynamoDB Tables:**

1. **players**: Player accounts and authentication data
2. **characters**: Character records with skills, attributes, inventory
3. **archetypes**: Character class templates and starting configurations
4. **rooms**: MUD room definitions and descriptions
5. **exits**: Room connections for MUD navigation
6. **items**: Item instances in character inventories
7. **prototypes**: Item templates for creation
8. **motd**: Message of the Day entries
9. **story**: Story prototype definitions
10. **segments**: Segment prototype definitions
11. **active_segments**: Running segment instances
12. **story_history**: Completed story records
13. **segment_history**: Archived segment instances
14. **opponents**: Combat opponent definitions
15. **stores**: Live store stock counts (catalog stays in JSON config)

**Key Schema Patterns:**

- All tables use DeletionProtectionEnabled for data persistence
- GSI for secondary access patterns (CharacterNameIndex, EndTimeIndex)
- Server-side state authority with no client caching
- ProcessingStatus field for idempotent segment processing
- GameMode field for exclusive mode access (None/MUD/Incremental)

See [schema.md](schema.md) for detailed table schemas.

### 3. Lambda Functions

**Total Functions: 24**

All Lambda functions use `eidolon-lambda-execution-role` with:

- DynamoDB access via managed policy `eidolon-dynamodb-policy`
- CloudWatch Logs permissions
- Additional policies attached by dependent stacks

**API Layer (19 functions):**

- `api-archetype-list`: List available archetypes
- `api-character-add`: Create new character with name validation
- `api-character-delete`: Delete character
- `api-character-get`: Retrieve character details with GameMode cleanup
- `api-character-list`: List player's characters
- `api-item-brief`: Get lightweight item metadata for IndexedDB caching
- `api-item-consolidate`: Merge stackable items in inventory
- `api-item-consume`: Consume inventory items and apply effects
- `api-item-discard`: Remove items from inventory
- `api-item-prototype`: Get complete item prototype definition
- `api-item-split`: Split item stacks in inventory
- `api-segment-decision`: Record player choice in decision segment
- `api-segment-history`: Get segment history for character
- `api-segment-status`: Get current segment status
- `api-store-list`: List available store items
- `api-store-purchase`: Purchase items from store
- `api-story-abandon`: Mark story as abandoned and reset GameMode
- `api-story-history`: Get story history
- `api-story-start`: Initiate story and enable polling

**Operational Layer (3 functions):**

- `ops-segment-poller`: EventBridge-triggered poller (1-minute schedule)
- `ops-segment-process`: Process mechanical segments via SQS
- `ops-story-advance`: Advance story and create next segment via SQS

**Cognito Functions (2 functions):**

- `cognito-player-new`: PostConfirmation trigger for new accounts
- `cognito-player-delete`: Player deletion handler for GDPR compliance

**Lambda Configuration:**

- **Runtime**: Python 3.12
- **Memory**: 128MB
- **Timeout**: 30 seconds
- **Layer**: `eidolon-dependencies` (shared Python packages)
- **Post-Deploy Updates**: Functions updated from S3 artifacts after stack deployment

### 4. Queue Architecture

The dual-queue design separates immediate mechanical processing from timed segment advancement:

**processing-queue:**

- Target: `ops-segment-process` Lambda
- Purpose: Immediate processing of mechanical segments
- Configuration: 24-hour retention (matches the longest segment cycle),
  180-second visibility (6x the worker timeout)

**advancement-queue:**

- Target: `ops-story-advance` Lambda
- Purpose: Timed processing of all segment types
- Configuration: 24-hour retention, 180-second visibility

There are deliberately no dead-letter queues: the database is the
authoritative state and messages are disposable nudges the poller regenerates
from table state, so a lost or expired message costs nothing.

**Processing Flow:**

1. Mechanical segments queued immediately at creation
2. All segments queued to advancement when timer expires
3. ProcessingStatus field ensures idempotent processing

### 5. Polling Infrastructure

**EventBridge Rule:** `eidolon-story-poller`

- Schedule: rate(1 minute)
- Target: `ops-segment-poller` Lambda
- State: DISABLED by default, enabled when stories start

**SSM Parameter:** `/eidolon/story/config`

- Values: "run" or "stop"
- Controls polling execution
- Auto-managed based on active segment count

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Initial: System startup
    Initial --> PollingActive: Player starts story
    PollingActive --> PollingStopped: No segments found
    PollingStopped --> PollingActive: Active segments found
    PollingStopped --> Initial: No active segments

    note right of Initial
        State: Parameter=stop, Rule=DISABLED
    end note

    note right of PollingActive
        State: Parameter=run, Rule=ENABLED
        Trigger: api-story-start
        Actions:
        - Sets SSM parameter to run
        - Enables EventBridge rule
    end note

    note left of PollingStopped
        State: Parameter=stop, Rule=ENABLED
        Triggers:
        - ops-segment-poller finds no segments
        - ops-story-advance completes last story
        Actions:
        - Sets SSM parameter to stop
    end note

    note left of Initial
        Return to initial state:
        - ops-segment-poller finds no active segments
        - Disables EventBridge rule
    end note
```

**Stuck Segment Recovery:**

- Segments stuck longer than 60 seconds get retried while at least 30 seconds
  remain before EndTime
- ProcessingStatus reset to "pending" to allow reprocessing
- At expiry, an unprocessed segment gets one recovery requeue, then is marked
  "exceptional" (player-favorable); dead-worker claims resolve after a grace
  period (see incremental-story.md, Error Recovery and Edge Cases)

## Game Mechanics

### State Machines

The system uses several state machines to manage game flow and ensure data consistency:

**Character GameMode State Machine:**

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> None: Character created
    None --> Incremental: Start story<br/>(api-story-start)
    None --> MUD: Enter MUD<br/>(future implementation)
    Incremental --> None: Story completes<br/>(ops-story-advance)
    Incremental --> None: Story abandoned<br/>(api-story-abandon)
    MUD --> None: Exit MUD<br/>(future implementation)
    None --> [*]

    note right of None
        Allowed transitions:
        - None to Incremental story start
        - None to MUD enter MUD

        No direct transitions between
        Incremental and MUD allowed.
        Must return to None first.
    end note

    note right of Incremental
        Character state when in Incremental:
        - GameMode = Incremental
        - ActiveStoryID set UUID
        - ActiveSegmentID set UUID

        Validation on story start:
        - GameMode MUST be None
        - ActiveStoryID MUST be null
        - ActiveSegmentID MUST be null
    end note

    note left of MUD
        Character state when in MUD:
        - GameMode = MUD
        - MUD-specific fields active

        Future implementation will
        follow same exclusive access
        pattern as Incremental.
    end note
```

**Segment ProcessingStatus State Machine:**

DynamoDB conditional writes ensure atomic state transitions, preventing duplicate processing even under high concurrency.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> pending: Segment created
    pending --> processing: ops-segment-process<br/>claims segment
    processing --> processed: Processing completes<br/>successfully
    processed --> [*]

    note right of pending
        Initial state when ActiveSegment created.

        Segment awaits processing by:
        - ops-segment-process mechanical
        - ops-story-advance decision or all
    end note

    note right of processing
        Atomic transition using DynamoDB
        conditional write:

        ConditionExpression:
        ProcessingStatus = :pending

        Only ONE Lambda can claim
        the segment for processing.
        Prevents duplicate processing.
    end note

    note left of processed
        Terminal state indicating:
        - Outcome calculated
        - CharacterUpdates applied
        - Segment safe to advance

        Idempotent: Multiple attempts
        to mark processed are safe.
        Uses conditional write to
        prevent state corruption.
    end note
```

**Story Lifecycle State Machine:**

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Available
    Available --> Active: Story started<br/>(api-story-start)
    Active --> Completed: Final segment completes<br/>(ops-story-advance)
    Active --> Abandoned: Story abandoned<br/>(api-story-abandon)
    Completed --> Available: Cooldown expires<br/>(daily/repeatable)
    Completed --> [*]: One-time story
    Abandoned --> Available: Can retry

    note right of Available
        Story in AvailableStories array.

        Prerequisites checked:
        - Skill requirements met
        - Required items present
        - Cooldown expired if any

        Cooldown types:
        - one-time: Permanent after completion
        - daily: Reset at UTC midnight
        - repeatable: No cooldown
    end note

    note right of Active
        Character fields during Active:
        - ActiveStoryID = story UUID
        - ActiveSegmentID = current segment
        - GameMode = Incremental

        StoryHistory entry created with:
        - StoryInstanceID UUIDv7
        - StartedAt timestamp
        - SegmentHistory array
    end note

    note left of Completed
        On completion:
        - Add to CompletedStories if StoryType is
          "one-time" or "daily" (not "repeatable")
        - Clear ActiveStoryID
        - Clear ActiveSegmentID
        - Set GameMode = None
        - Update StoryHistory:
          * FinishedAt timestamp
          * FinalOutcome
          * TotalXP earned
    end note

    note left of Abandoned
        On abandonment:
        - Record in StoryHistory only (not in character)
        - Clear ActiveStoryID
        - Clear ActiveSegmentID
        - Set GameMode = None
        - Update StoryHistory:
          * AbandonedAt timestamp
          * No FinalOutcome

        Abandoned stories can be
        retried immediately.
    end note
```

### Health and Wounds System

The wound tracking system models individual injuries that heal over time, creating realistic consequences and strategic healing mechanics.

**Health Calculation:**

Current health is calculated dynamically based on wound count.

```
Health = MaxHealth - len(Wounds)
```

Each wound is a map structure:

```json
{
  "DamageType": "lethal",
  "HealAt": "2025-01-15T20:00:00Z"
}
```

**Wound Types:**

- **Bashing**: Heal in 15 minutes (bruises, stunning)
- **Lethal**: Heal in 6 hours (serious injuries)
- **Aggravated**: Heal in 7 days (grievous wounds)

**Character States:**

- **Standing**: Health > 0, normal activity
- **Unconscious**: Health = 0 with at least one bashing wound
- **Dead**: Health = 0 with only lethal/aggravated wounds

**Cross-Mode Persistence:**

- Wounds received in either mode persist when switching
- Healing continues automatically regardless of active game mode
- Strategic timing of mode switches can optimize healing downtime

### Combat System

**Dual Action System:**

- Each combatant performs offensive and defensive actions per round
- Character uses best offensive skill (Arcane/Brawling/Melee/Archery)
- Defense determined by offensive choice (Parry for Melee, Dodge otherwise)

**Damage Application:**

- Success on opposed check = damage to opponent
- Sigma > 3.0 = critical hit (2 wounds)
- Normal hit = 1 wound
- Wound type from weapon (bashing/lethal/aggravated)

**Victory Conditions:**

- **Opponent Defeated**: Lethal wounds ≥ Health OR Total wounds ≥ Health × 2
- **Character Defeated**: Lethal wounds ≥ 5 OR Total wounds ≥ 10
- **Timeout**: Max rounds reached, opponent escapes (failure)

**Outcome Quality:**

- **Exceptional**: Victory with 0 wounds
- **Normal**: Victory with 1-2 wounds
- **Minimal**: Victory with 3+ wounds
- **Failure**: Opponent escapes or character incapacitated
- **Death**: Character reaches lethal wound threshold

### Experience System

**XP Calculation:**

- Base XP + difficulty modifier (abs(diff) × 0.5)
- Success penalty: 0 XP for failing easy checks
- Failure penalty: 50% XP for failing hard checks

**XP Distribution:**

- **Skill XP**: Full amount to used skill
- **Attribute XP**: 10% of skill XP to governing attribute

**XP Accumulation:**

- All checks in a segment accumulate XP
- Applied immediately during segment processing
- Persists across mode switches (MUD ↔ Incremental)

## Deployment Architecture

### Stack Dependencies

    style LambdaStacks fill:#d4edda
    style Cognito fill:#f8d7da
    style APIGateway fill:#d1ecf1
    style ClientBuild fill:#e2e3e5
```

### Deployment Modes

**MUD Mode (11 Stacks):**

- Excludes the story stack (no SQS/EventBridge)
- Includes the Lua scripts bucket and CloudWatch
- Portal frontend via `buildspec/portal.yml`

**Incremental Mode (11 Stacks):**

- Includes the story stack for segment processing
- Excludes the CloudWatch stack
- Incremental frontend via `buildspec/incremental.yml`

**Hybrid Mode (12 Stacks - Default):**

- Includes all stacks for complete functionality
- Supports both MUD and Incremental gameplay
- Incremental frontend with mode selection

### Deployment Process

The canonical stack inventory and sequence live in
[Deployment Guide](deployment.md#system-architecture). In brief: roles ->
DynamoDB -> certificates -> CodeBuild (layer and function builds) -> Cognito
functions and pool -> character functions -> story functions
(incremental/hybrid) -> API Gateway -> client CloudFront and CodeBuild ->
client build -> Lua scripts (MUD) -> CloudWatch (MUD/hybrid) -> config
update.

**Key Deployment Features:**

- Fixed logical IDs and resource names prevent resource recreation
- Parameters flow from `config.yml` and prior stacks' outputs
- Automated end-to-end from infrastructure to client
- Post-deployment Lambda updates from S3

### Multi-Account Strategy

**Environment Isolation:**

- **Development**: Separate AWS account for individual developer testing
- **Staging**: Dedicated AWS account for integration testing
- **Production**: Isolated AWS account for live system

**Benefits:**

- Complete isolation with no resource name conflicts
- Account-level security separation
- Clear cost attribution per environment
- No complex environment-based permissions needed

**Resource Naming:**

- Same names across accounts (account isolation eliminates conflicts)
- No environment prefixes needed
- Consistent configuration structure

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Concurrency Control

The system uses DynamoDB conditional writes to ensure atomic state transitions and prevent race conditions:

- **ProcessingStatus Field**: Ensures only one Lambda processes each segment
- **GameMode Field**: Prevents concurrent access between MUD and Incremental modes
- **Conditional Updates**: All state transitions use atomic DynamoDB operations
- **Idempotent Processing**: SQS at-least-once delivery with deduplication

### Recovery Mechanisms

**Automatic Recovery Paths:**

1. **Character Retrieval Cleanup**: `api-character-get` resets GameMode to None if no ActiveStoryID/ActiveSegmentID
2. **Polling System Recovery**: EventBridge triggers `ops-segment-poller` every minute to find stuck segments
3. **Stuck Segment Recovery**: Segments stuck >5 minutes get ProcessingStatus reset to "pending" for retry
4. **Timeout Protection**: Segments past EndTime marked "exceptional" (player-favorable outcome)

**Failure Scenarios and Handling:**

| Failure Type              | Detection              | Recovery                   | Maximum Recovery Time |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Client crash/network loss | Next API call          | Automatic GameMode cleanup | Immediate             |
| Lambda timeout            | Polling system         | Retry with new Lambda      | 1 minute              |
| Processing stuck          | ProcessingStatus check | Reset to pending           | ~2 minutes            |
| Orphaned segments         | EndTime exceeded       | Recovery requeue, then exceptional | 2-3 minutes   |
| Queue message loss        | Poller scan            | Re-queue segment           | 1 minute              |

**Protection Mechanisms:**

- Player-favorable defaults for all timeout scenarios
- History tables provide complete audit trail
- No data loss - all state persisted in DynamoDB (queue messages are
  disposable; the poller regenerates them)

## Performance Optimization

**Database:**

- Pay-per-request DynamoDB pricing (no capacity planning)
- GSI for efficient secondary access patterns
- Conditional writes prevent race conditions

**Lambda:**

- Cold start caching of archetype data
- Shared dependency layer
- 128MB memory, 30-second timeout
- Post-deployment code updates from S3

**Queue:**

- Batch processing via SQS
- Auto-disable polling when inactive
- Immediate mechanical segment processing

**Client:**

- Front-loaded outcome calculation
- Server-authoritative state (no client sync)
- IndexedDB caching reduces API calls by 90%
- Two-tier item loading strategy

**IndexedDB Cache Domains:**

- **Stories**: Historical preservation for offline access
- **Characters**: Field-level updates (60+ calls/hour → 5-10)
- **Items**: Prototype caching with memory layer

See [Incremental Design](incremental-design.md#indexeddb-cache-layer-integration) for implementation details.

## Security Considerations

**Authentication:**

- Cognito User Pool (`eidolon-users`)
- API Gateway Cognito authorizer
- JWT validation on protected endpoints

**IAM:**

- Shared execution role: `eidolon-lambda-execution-role`
- Managed policies only (no inline)
- Least privilege per stack
- Fixed logical IDs prevent recreation

**CORS:**

- Lambda-level validation
- Environment variable configuration
- Credentials support

**State Protection:**

- GameMode modifications restricted to authorized Lambdas
- Conditional updates prevent race conditions
- ProcessingStatus ensures single processing
- All transitions validated

## Monitoring and Observability

**CloudWatch Integration:**

- All Lambda functions log to CloudWatch
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Error tracking with stack traces

**Metrics:**

- Lambda: Duration, errors, throttles
- DynamoDB: Read/write capacity, throttles
- SQS: Message age, queue depth
- Custom game event metrics

**Note**: Dashboards and alarms deferred until revenue generation.
