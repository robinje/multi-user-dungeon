# Incremental Story and Segment State Machines

## Overview

The Eidolon Engine's incremental game mode features a story-driven progression system where characters navigate through interconnected segments that form complete narratives. Stories are composed of segments, which are time-based activities that advance automatically once initiated. This document describes the state machines that govern both stories and segments, as well as the Lambda functions that implement the state transitions.

### Core Concepts

- **Story**: A complete narrative arc available to characters based on their archetype and progress
- **Segment**: A single timed activity within a story (mechanical challenges or decisions) — see [Incremental Requirements](incremental-requirements.md#24-segment-types) for canonical definitions
- **Front-loaded Processing**: All outcomes are calculated when segments start, not when they end
- **Event-driven Advancement**: A polling system checks every minute for completed segments
- **Mode Exclusivity**: Characters can only be active in one game mode at a time (MUD or Incremental); refer to [Character Mode Workflow](incremental-mud-workflow.md) for the full lifecycle

### Production Infrastructure

The story system relies on the infrastructure described in the [Deployment Guide](deployment.md#system-architecture) and shares the same Lambda and DynamoDB resources referenced throughout that document.

## Schema Elements

### Story Table

The Story table contains prototype definitions for all available stories:

- **StoryID** (HASH): UUID of the story
- **Title**: Display title of the story
- **StoryType**: one-time, daily, or repeatable
- **FirstSegmentID**: Starting segment UUID
- **Prerequisites**: Requirements to start (skills, items)
- **BaseXPMultiplier**: XP modifier (default 0.5, must be < 1.0)

### Segments Table

The Segments table contains prototype definitions for all story segments:

- **StoryID** (HASH): Parent story UUID
- **SegmentID** (RANGE): Segment UUID
- **SegmentType**: decision or mechanical
- **SegmentDuration**: Time in seconds for completion
- **DecisionOptions**: For decision segments, maps choice ID to option data (Text, Description, Narrative, NextSegmentID)
- **Results**: For mechanical segments, outcome-specific branches (see Weighted Branching below)
- **Challenges**: List of skill/attribute challenges (mechanical segments only)
- **Combat**: Combat configuration if applicable (mechanical segments only)
- **TimeoutBehavior**: For decisions, optional weighted timeout branches

### ActiveSegments Table

The ActiveSegments table tracks currently running segment instances:

- **ActiveSegmentID** (HASH): Instance UUID
- **CharacterID** (GSI): Character UUID for querying
- **ProcessingStatus**: pending → processing → processed (then segment deleted)
- **StartTime/EndTime**: Unix timestamps defining the segment window
- **ClientEvents**: Pre-calculated event sequence for display
- **CharacterUpdates**: Changes to apply on completion
- **Outcome**: death/failure/minimal/normal/exceptional
- **BranchMetadata**: Branch selection tracking (SelectionMethod, BranchLabel, BranchIndex, etc.)

### StoryHistory Table

Records completed story attempts (one per character-story combination):

- **CharacterID** (HASH): Character UUID
- **StoryInstanceID** (RANGE): UUIDv7 for this story instance (unique per execution)
- **StoryID**: UUID of the story
- **FinalOutcome**: Overall story result (death/failure/minimal/normal/exceptional/abandoned)
- **SegmentHistory**: List of ActiveSegmentIDs in chronological order
- **SkillXPAwarded/AttributeXPAwarded**: Total XP earned from all segments

Note: Each story attempt creates a new StoryInstanceID. The system does not track attempt numbers.

### SegmentHistory Table

Archives completed segment instances:

- **CharacterID** (HASH): Character UUID
- **ActiveSegmentID** (RANGE): Instance UUID from ActiveSegments
- **StoryInstanceID**: UUIDv7 of the story instance from StoryHistory
- **CharacterUpdates**: All character changes applied (contains SkillXP and AttributeXP)
- **Outcome**: Final outcome of the segment
- **ProcessedAt**: Unix timestamp when outcomes were calculated
- **BranchMetadata**: Copy of branch selection tracking from ActiveSegments

## Story State Machine

### States

Stories exist in one of these states relative to a character:

1. **Available**: Listed in character's AvailableStories array
2. **Active**: Character has ActiveStoryID set
3. **Completed**: Entry in CompletedStories list (one-time and daily stories only)
4. **Abandoned**: Tracked in story history only (not in character record)

### State Transitions

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Available
    Available --> Active: POST /story/start<br/>(api-story-start)
    Active --> Completed: Final segment completes<br/>(ops-story-advance)
    Active --> Abandoned: POST /story/abandon<br/>(api-story-abandon)
    Completed --> [*]
    Abandoned --> [*]

    note right of Available
        Story listed in character's
        AvailableStories array
    end note

    note right of Active
        Actions on activation:
        - Create ActiveSegment for first segment
        - Set GameMode = "Incremental"
        - Set ActiveStoryID and ActiveSegmentID
        - Queue mechanical segments
        - Enable polling infrastructure
        - Create StoryHistory entry
    end note

    note right of Completed
        Actions on completion:
        - Apply final updates and rewards
        - Add to CompletedStories if StoryType is
          "one-time" or "daily" (not "repeatable")
        - Format: {StoryID: {"StoryType": "daily", "CompletedAt": timestamp}}
        - Clear ActiveStoryID/ActiveSegmentID
        - Set GameMode = "None"
        - Update StoryHistory with FinalOutcome
        - Delete ActiveSegment record
        Note: Death/failure are completed
        attempts with negative outcomes
    end note

    note right of Abandoned
        Actions on abandonment:
        - Record in StoryHistory only
        - Do NOT add to character record
        - Clear ActiveStoryID/ActiveSegmentID
        - Set GameMode = "None"
        - Update StoryHistory (abandoned)
        - Mark ActiveSegment as abandoned
        Note: Only player-initiated quits
    end note
```

### Story Lifecycle

1. **Initialization** (from prototype):
   - Story definitions loaded from Story table
   - Available stories determined by archetype and prerequisites
   - Added to character's AvailableStories list

2. **Activation**:
   - Player selects story via api-story-start
   - First segment copied from Segments table
   - ActiveSegment instance created with calculated outcomes
   - Character state atomically updated

3. **Progression**:
   - Segments advance one by one
   - Each segment completion triggers next segment creation
   - Story remains active until terminal outcome or completion

4. **Completion**:
   - Final segment processed by ops-story-advance
   - All rewards and effects applied
   - Story moved to history tables
   - Character returned to idle state

### Story Types and Repeatability

Stories have a `StoryType` field that determines their repeatability:

1. **one-time**: Can only be completed once per character

   - Added to CompletedStories on first start (not completion)
   - Permanently blocks subsequent attempts
   - Entry format: `{StoryID: {"StoryType": "one-time", "CompletedAt": timestamp}}`
   - Example: Discovery quests, unique narrative events

2. **daily**: Can be repeated after 24-hour cooldown

   - Added to CompletedStories on start
   - Entry format: `{StoryID: {"StoryType": "daily", "CompletedAt": timestamp}}`
   - Automatically removed from CompletedStories after 24 hours (UTC)
   - Cleanup occurs during character load (api-character-get)
   - Example: Resource gathering, routine tasks

3. **repeatable**: Can be repeated immediately
   - Never added to CompletedStories
   - No tracking or cooldown
   - Example: Combat training, random encounters

**CompletedStories Structure:**

```json
"CompletedStories": [
  {"story-uuid-1": {"StoryType": "one-time", "CompletedAt": 1729468900}},
  {"story-uuid-2": {"StoryType": "daily", "CompletedAt": 1729555200}}
]
```

**Story Eligibility Logic:**

- Check AvailableStories list (must be present)
- Check CompletedStories for story ID:
  - If found with `StoryType: "one-time"` → Blocked permanently
  - If found with `StoryType: "daily"` → Blocked until cleanup (shouldn't happen if cleanup works)
  - If not found → Allowed to start

## Segment State Machine

### Processing Status States

Segments use ProcessingStatus to track their processing state:

1. **pending**: Mechanical segments awaiting processing
2. **processing**: Mechanical segments currently being processed
3. **processed**: Segment ready for advancement when timer expires

**Note**: There is no "completed" ProcessingStatus. When a segment advances (timer expires),
it is deleted from ActiveSegments and archived to SegmentHistory. The segment lifecycle ends
at "processed" status.

### ProcessingStatus Concurrency Control

The ProcessingStatus field provides atomic state transitions to prevent duplicate processing:

- **false** (or absent): Segment available for processing
- **true**: Segment claimed by a Lambda instance for exclusive processing

This is implemented as a DynamoDB conditional update to ensure atomicity. Despite documentation
suggesting it would store a request ID, the implementation uses a simple boolean for efficiency.

### Complete State Transitions

#### Mechanical Segments

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> pending: Created
    pending --> processing: SQS message received
    processing --> processed: Processing completes
    processed --> [*]: EndTime reached

    note right of pending
        Trigger: Story start or segment advancement
        Lambda: api-story-start / ops-story-advance
        Actions:
        - Create ActiveSegment (status="pending")
        - Set timers (StartTime, EndTime)
        - IMMEDIATELY queue to SEGMENT_QUEUE_URL
    end note

    note right of processing
        Trigger: SQS message from immediate queueing
        Lambda: ops-segment-process (via SQS)
        Actions:
        - Atomic transition pending → processing
        - Process challenges and combat
        - Apply XP and wounds immediately
        - Store results in segment
    end note

    note right of processed
        Trigger: Processing completes
        Lambda: ops-segment-process
        Actions:
        - Update segment with results
        - Set ProcessingStatus = "processed"
    end note

    note left of [*]
        Trigger: EndTime reached (within 30s)
        Lambda: ops-segment-poller → ops-story-advance
        Actions:
        - Apply CharacterUpdates
        - Create next segment or complete story
        - Copy to SegmentHistory
        - Delete from ActiveSegments
    end note
```

#### Decision Segments

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> processed: Created (with default)
    processed --> processed: Player updates decision
    processed --> [*]: EndTime reached

    note right of processed
        Created: Story advancement
        Lambda: ops-story-advance
        Actions:
        - Create ActiveSegment (status="processed")
        - Set Decision = DefaultDecision
        - Set NextSegmentID from default choice
        - Set timers (StartTime, EndTime)
    end note

    note left of processed
        Decision Update: Player makes choice
        Lambda: api-segment-decision
        Actions:
        - Update Decision field
        - Update NextSegmentID based on choice
        - ProcessingStatus remains "processed"
    end note

    note left of [*]
        Trigger: EndTime reached (within 30s)
        Lambda: ops-segment-poller → ops-story-advance
        Actions:
        - Use Decision field to determine path
        - Create next segment (NextSegmentID)
        - Copy to SegmentHistory
        - Delete from ActiveSegments
    end note
```

### Segment Types and Processing

#### Mechanical Segments

- Contain exactly **one** mechanical challenge: either a single non-combat challenge OR a combat challenge
- **IMPORTANT**: Do not combine multiple challenges in one segment (no combat + skill check, no multiple skill checks)
- Queued IMMEDIATELY at creation to SEGMENT_QUEUE_URL
- Processed by ops-segment-process via SQS
- XP and wounds applied during processing
- Outcomes: death/failure/minimal/normal/exceptional

#### Decision Segments

Decision segments present player choices and contain no skill checks, combat, or mechanical calculations. All game mechanics belong in mechanical segments.

- Present story choices to the player
- Created with ProcessingStatus="processed" and default decision pre-applied
- Player can override decision via api-segment-decision before timer expires
- NextSegmentID is always set (either default or player's choice)
- Timer expiry uses whatever Decision is currently set
- Generate ClientEvents with narrative text to enrich segment history
- **No Difficulty ratings** - decision segments are for player choice, not mechanics

#### Challenge Outcome Design

Non-combat challenges should generally result in segment repetition on failure, allowing players to retry until they succeed or choose to abandon the story. However, certain challenge types warrant different outcomes based on narrative context:

**Repeatable Challenges** (default pattern):

- **Investigation challenges**: Failed investigation attempts should loop back to the same segment, allowing the player to retry
- **Puzzle challenges**: Failed puzzle attempts typically repeat the segment
- **Social challenges**: Failed persuasion or negotiation attempts generally allow retry
- **Skill checks without consequences**: Any challenge where failure doesn't change the physical situation

Example branching for investigation challenge:

```json
"Results": {
  "Failure": {
    "Narrative": "You search the room but find nothing useful...",
    "NextSegmentID": "same-segment-id"  // Repeat this segment
  },
  "Normal": {
    "Narrative": "You discover a hidden compartment...",
    "NextSegmentID": "next-segment-id"  // Progress forward
  }
}
```

**Progressive Challenges** (contextual branching):

- **Physical consequences**: Challenges where failure changes the situation should progress the story
- **Environmental hazards**: Failed navigation or tumbling challenges that result in falling or injury
- **Time-sensitive challenges**: Challenges where failure represents time passing or opportunity lost
- **Irreversible actions**: Attempts that cannot be undone once initiated

Example branching for tumbling while climbing:

```json
"Results": {
  "Failure": {
    "Narrative": "You lose your grip and tumble down through the branches...",
    "NextSegmentID": "forest-floor-segment"  // Earlier in story, different location
  },
  "Normal": {
    "Narrative": "You navigate the treetops successfully...",
    "NextSegmentID": "canopy-destination-segment"  // Continue upward
  }
}
```

**Design Principles**:

1. **Default to repetition**: Unless there's a narrative reason for progression, failed non-combat challenges should repeat
2. **Consider context**: Physical challenges with consequences (falling, injury, detection) should progress the story
3. **Provide alternatives**: If a segment doesn't repeat on failure, ensure the new path is interesting and not purely punitive
4. **Avoid dead ends**: Progressive failures should lead to viable story paths, not immediate death or story termination

#### Wound Healing

Wound healing is time-based and independent of segments. Wounds heal based on their type:

- Bashing wounds: heal after 15 minutes from infliction
- Lethal wounds: heal after 6 hours from infliction
- Aggravated wounds: heal after 7 days from infliction

### Flexible Branching Design

#### Outcome-Based Branching

The story system supports flexible narrative branching where any outcome can lead to different paths. Each segment's Results block maps outcomes to their consequences:

```json
"Results": {
  "Death": {
    "Narrative": "Your journey ends here...",
    "NextSegmentID": null  // Story ends
  },
  "Failure": {
    "Narrative": "You are captured by guards...",
    "NextSegmentID": "prison-escape-segment"  // Continue in prison
  },
  "Minimal": {
    "Narrative": "You barely succeed...",
    "NextSegmentID": "next-segment-wounded"  // Different path
  },
  "Normal": {
    "Narrative": "You succeed as expected...",
    "NextSegmentID": "next-segment-standard"  // Standard path
  },
  "Exceptional": {
    "Narrative": "Your exceptional performance is noted...",
    "NextSegmentID": "next-segment-bonus"  // Bonus path
  }
}
```

#### Non-Traditional Death Handling

Death outcomes don't always end the story. The system supports:

- **Ghost Stories**: Death leads to afterlife segments
- **Divine Intervention**: Death triggers resurrection paths
- **Underworld Journeys**: Death begins a new quest
- **Reincarnation**: Death leads to rebirth scenarios

**Implementation Note:** Ghost state is defined in health.md specification and implemented in MUD server, but NOT in Incremental mode (Python constants.py missing ghost state). This limits death-continuation storylines in current implementation.

Example (design concept):

```json
"Death": {
  "Narrative": "As darkness takes you, you feel your spirit rise...",
  "NextSegmentID": "ghost-revenge-segment-1",
  "Effects": {
    "State": "ghost"  // NOT IMPLEMENTED in Incremental
  }
}
```

#### Failure as Opportunity

Failure outcomes can open entirely new storylines:

- **Capture and Escape**: Failure leads to prison break stories
- **Redemption Arcs**: Failure triggers second chance narratives
- **Alternative Solutions**: Failure reveals hidden paths
- **Training Montages**: Failure leads to improvement segments

Example:

```json
"Failure": {
  "Narrative": "The master shakes his head. 'You need more training.'",
  "NextSegmentID": "training-montage-segment",
  "Effects": {
    "Room": 15  // Training grounds
  }
}
```

#### Weighted Branching with Prerequisites

The system supports weighted random branching where a single outcome can lead to multiple possible paths based on probability and character prerequisites. This allows for dynamic narrative variation and stat-gated content.

**Structure:**

```json
"Results": {
  "Normal": {
    "Narrative": "You examine the paths ahead...",
    "Branches": [
      {
        "NextSegmentID": "segment-easy",
        "Weight": 0.6,
        "Label": "common_path",
        "Prerequisites": {
          "MinSkills": {"perception": 3},
          "MinAttributes": {"intelligence": 2}
        }
      },
      {
        "NextSegmentID": "segment-hard",
        "Weight": 0.4,
        "Label": "challenging_path",
        "Prerequisites": {
          "MinSkills": {"perception": 7}
        }
      }
    ],
    "FallbackSegmentID": "segment-default"
  }
}
```

**Selection Process:**

1. **Filter by Prerequisites**: Check character skills, attributes, and required items
2. **Renormalize Weights**: Adjust weights for only the available branches
3. **Random Selection**: Use cryptographically secure random (secrets module)
4. **Apply Fallback**: If no branches pass prerequisites, use FallbackSegmentID
5. **Track Metadata**: Store selection details in BranchMetadata field

**Branch Metadata:**

All branch selections are tracked in the ActiveSegments and SegmentHistory records:

- `SelectionMethod`: weighted_random, prerequisite_fallback, player_decision, etc.
- `BranchLabel`: Analytics label from the selected branch
- `BranchIndex`: Which branch was selected (0-indexed)
- `TotalBranches`: How many branches were defined
- `AvailableBranches`: How many passed prerequisite checks
- `RandomSeed`: Seed used for selection (testing only)

**Weighted Decision Timeouts:**

Decision segments can use weighted random selection on timeout instead of a fixed default:

```json
{
  "SegmentType": "decision",
  "DecisionOptions": {
    "investigate": { "NextSegmentID": "seg-investigate" },
    "flee": { "NextSegmentID": "seg-flee" }
  },
  "TimeoutBehavior": {
    "Type": "weighted",
    "Branches": [
      { "Decision": "investigate", "Weight": 0.7 },
      { "Decision": "flee", "Weight": 0.3 }
    ]
  },
  "DefaultDecision": "flee"
}
```

If TimeoutBehavior is not specified, the system falls back to DefaultDecision.

**Validation:**

Use `scripts_python/validate_branching.py` to validate:

- Branch weights sum to 1.0 (tolerance: 0.001)
- NextSegmentIDs reference valid segments in the story
- Prerequisite structure is valid
- No circular dependencies exist

#### Branching Principles

1. **No Hardcoded Assumptions**: The system doesn't assume death or failure ends stories
2. **Narrative Freedom**: Designers control all branching through data
3. **Outcome Equality**: Any outcome can lead to any result
4. **Conditional Progression**: Different outcomes create different player experiences
5. **Stat-Based Gating**: Branches can require specific skills/attributes to unlock
6. **Probabilistic Variation**: Weighted branches create replay value

### Segment Lifecycle

1. **Creation** (from prototype):
   - Segment definition loaded from Segments table
   - ActiveSegment instance created with UUID
   - All outcomes calculated immediately (front-loaded)
   - ClientEvents generated for entire duration

2. **Processing** (mechanical only):
   - Poller detects segment ready for processing
   - Queued to SQS for ops-segment-process
   - Challenges evaluated, combat simulated
   - XP and wounds applied to character

3. **Waiting**:
   - Segment timer runs (SegmentDuration)
   - Client displays events over time
   - No server processing during wait

4. **Advancement**:
   - Poller detects EndTime reached
   - Queued to SQS for ops-story-advance
   - Character updates applied
   - Next segment created or story completed

5. **Archival**:
   - All segment data copied to SegmentHistory
   - ActiveSegment record deleted
   - History preserved for analytics

## Lambda Function Machinery

### Production Configuration

All Lambda functions are deployed with:

- **Runtime**: Python 3.12
- **Memory**: 128MB
- **Timeout**: 30 seconds
- **Shared Execution Role**: `eidolon-lambda-execution-role`
- **DynamoDB Policy**: `eidolon-dynamodb-policy` with DescribeTable permission
- **Fixed Logical IDs**: Preventing recreation on stack updates
- **Post-Deployment Updates**: Functions updated from S3 artifacts

### API Layer Functions

**api-story-start** (Logical ID: `ApiStoryStartFunction`):

- Validates prerequisites and character state
- Creates first ActiveSegment with pre-calculated outcomes
- Updates character to active game mode (GameMode="Incremental")
- Queues mechanical segments to `eidolon-processing-queue`
- **Polling Management**: Sets SSM parameter to "run" AND enables EventBridge rule
- Environment: `SEGMENT_QUEUE_URL` for SQS integration

**api-segment-decision** (Logical ID: `ApiSegmentDecisionFunction`):

- Records player choice in Decision field
- Sets DecisionMadeAt timestamp
- Returns confirmation to client

**api-story-abandon** (Logical ID: `ApiStoryAbandonFunction`):

- Marks story as abandoned
- Clears character active state
- Records in StoryHistory

### Processing Layer Functions

**ops-segment-poller** (Logical ID: `OpsSegmentPollerFunction`):

- **Trigger**: EventBridge rule `eidolon-story-poller` (1-minute schedule)
- Reads SSM parameter `/eidolon/story/config` for "run"/"stop" state
- Queries for segments with EndTime <= now
- Sends ALL completed segments to `eidolon-advancement-queue`
- **Polling State Management**:
  - If parameter="run" and no segments found: Sets parameter to "stop"
  - If parameter="stop": Checks for active segments
    - If active segments exist: Sets parameter back to "run"
    - If no active segments: Disables EventBridge rule
- Environment: `SSM_POLLER_STATE_PARAMETER` (defaults to `/eidolon/story/config`), queue URLs

**ops-segment-process** (Logical ID: `OpsSegmentProcessFunction`):

- **Trigger**: SQS `eidolon-processing-queue`
- Claims segment by transitioning ProcessingStatus to processing (prevents duplicates)
- Processes mechanical challenges and combat
- Applies XP and wounds immediately to character
- Updates segment with outcome and results
- **No polling management** - focused solely on segment processing
- Environment: `SEGMENT_BATCH_SIZE` for processing limits

**ops-story-advance** (Logical ID: `OpsStoryAdvanceFunction`):

- **Trigger**: SQS `eidolon-advancement-queue`
- Claims segment by checking ProcessingStatus for idempotency
- Processes simple segments (decision) if not already processed
- Applies deferred CharacterUpdates (combat rewards, story effects)
- Creates next segment or completes story
- **Polling Management**: When story completes (next_segment_id is None):
  - Checks if any active segments remain
  - If none: Sets SSM parameter to "stop" (does NOT touch EventBridge)
- Resets GameMode="None" when story completes
- Writes to story_history and segment_history tables

### Queue Architecture

**Production Queue Configuration**:

**eidolon-processing-queue** (SQS Standard Queue):

- URL: `https://sqs.{region}.amazonaws.com/{account}/eidolon-processing-queue`
- Feeds ops-segment-process Lambda
- Handles mechanical segments only
- Message retention: 24 hours (matches the longest segment cycle)
- Visibility timeout: 180 seconds (6x the worker timeout)
- No dead-letter queue (by design - messages are disposable nudges the poller
  regenerates from database state)

**eidolon-advancement-queue** (SQS Standard Queue):

- URL: `https://sqs.{region}.amazonaws.com/{account}/eidolon-advancement-queue`
- Feeds ops-story-advance Lambda
- Handles all segment types for completion
- Message retention: 24 hours
- Visibility timeout: 180 seconds
- No dead-letter queue (by design)

### Polling Infrastructure

**IMPORTANT: The Poller's Role**

The ops-segment-poller Lambda (triggered every minute by EventBridge) uses a **two-query approach** for different segment scenarios:

**Query 1 - Segments Approaching Expiry** (within 60 seconds, including already past):

- Finds ALL segments that will expire before the next poll
- For processed segments: Queues them to STORY_ADVANCEMENT_QUEUE for normal advancement
- For unprocessed segments: one recovery requeue, then the exceptional outcome; dead-worker claims resolve after a grace period (see [Error Recovery and Edge Cases](#error-recovery-and-edge-cases))

**Query 2 - Stuck Mechanical Segments**:

- Finds mechanical segments where:
  - StartTime more than `SEGMENT_STUCK_RETRY_SECONDS` (60s) ago
  - EndTime more than `SEGMENT_RETRY_MIN_REMAINING_SECONDS` (30s) from now
  - ProcessingStatus is "pending" or "processing"
- Resets stuck "processing" segments to "pending"
- Re-queues them to SEGMENT_QUEUE_URL for retry

**The poller does NOT**:

- Initially queue mechanical segments (that happens immediately at creation)
- Process segments directly (all processing goes through SQS queues)
- Create segments (only api-story-start and ops-story-advance create segments)

**SSM Parameter** (`/eidolon/story/config`):

- Stores polling state: "run" or "stop" (string values, not JSON)
- Checked by poller each invocation
- **State Transitions**:
  - Set to "run" by: api-story-start, ops-segment-poller (when finding active segments)
  - Set to "stop" by: ops-story-advance (when completing last story), ops-segment-poller (when no segments to process)

**EventBridge Rule** (`eidolon-story-poller`):

- Schedule: rate(1 minute)
- Target: ops-segment-poller Lambda
- State: DISABLED by default
- **Enable/Disable Authority**:
  - api-story-start can enable the rule
  - ONLY ops-segment-poller can disable the rule (when parameter="stop" and no active segments)
- Race condition window: <100ms between final check and disable (acceptable)

### Polling State Flow

The polling system follows this state machine:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Initial: System startup
    Initial --> PollingActive: Player starts story
    PollingActive --> PollingStopped: No segments found / Story completes
    PollingStopped --> PollingActive: Active segments found
    PollingStopped --> Initial: No active segments

    note right of Initial
        State: Parameter="stop", Rule=DISABLED
    end note

    note right of PollingActive
        State: Parameter="run", Rule=ENABLED
        Trigger: api-story-start
        Actions:
        - Sets SSM parameter to "run"
        - Enables EventBridge rule
    end note

    note left of PollingStopped
        State: Parameter="stop", Rule=ENABLED
        Triggers:
        - ops-segment-poller finds no segments
        - ops-story-advance completes last story
        Actions:
        - Sets SSM parameter to "stop"
    end note

        - ops-segment-poller finds no active segments
        - Disables EventBridge rule
    end note
```

**Key Design Principles**:

- Separation of concerns: SSM parameter controls polling behavior, EventBridge rule controls execution
- Single responsibility: Each Lambda has specific polling authority
- Fail fast on enablement: api-story-start fails the request if the EventBridge rule cannot be enabled (a story started without a running poller would never advance); it enables polling before creating any story records, so the failure leaves nothing to roll back
- Self-correction: an SSM update failure is non-fatal - the poller flips the parameter back to "run" whenever active segments exist
- Cost optimization: Automatic shutdown when no stories active

## Error Recovery and Edge Cases

The poller (`ops-segment-poller`, every minute while polling is enabled) is
the recovery authority. Every segment is guaranteed to either process normally
or resolve deterministically; the constants live in `eidolon/constants.py`.

### Stuck Segment Recovery (mid-flight)

A worker normally processes a mechanical segment within seconds of its
StartTime, so one still `pending` or `processing` more than
`SEGMENT_STUCK_RETRY_SECONDS` (60s) after StartTime means the queue message
was lost or the worker died. While at least
`SEGMENT_RETRY_MIN_REMAINING_SECONDS` (30s) remain before EndTime, the poller
resets a `processing` claim back to `pending` and requeues the segment.
Segments too short to ever satisfy both bounds are recovered at expiry
instead (below).

### Expiry Recovery

When a segment comes within 60 seconds of its EndTime (or is already past
it), the poller resolves it by ProcessingStatus:

- **processed**: queued for normal advancement.
- **pending, mechanical**: requeued once for a final processing attempt
  (tracked by a conditional `RecoveryAttempted` flag, so concurrent pollers
  cannot double-queue it). If it is still unprocessed on the next poll, it is
  marked completed with the **exceptional** outcome - the player-favorable
  system-failure protection - and advanced.
- **pending, decision**: queued for advancement, which applies the
  DefaultDecision or failure handling.
- **processing**: left alone while the claim is plausibly alive; once
  `SEGMENT_PROCESSING_GRACE_SECONDS` (120s) past EndTime - far beyond the
  worker's 30s timeout - the worker is presumed dead and the segment is
  resolved exceptionally rather than stranded.

### Concurrent Processing Prevention

- ProcessingStatus state machine prevents duplicate processing
- Atomic DynamoDB operations ensure consistency
- SQS provides at-least-once delivery; duplicate enqueues are benign because
  workers must win the conditional pending-to-processing claim before doing
  any work

### Failure Modes

**Queue Message Loss**:

- The stuck scan requeues mid-flight segments; the expiry path requeues
  short segments once
- Idempotent processing prevents double application
- History tables provide audit trail

**Worker Death (Lambda timeout or crash)**:

- Mid-flight: claim reset to pending and requeued by the stuck scan
- Near or past EndTime: resolved exceptionally after the processing grace
  period, so no segment stays `processing` forever

## Summary

The Eidolon Engine's incremental story system implements a robust state machine architecture that ensures reliable progression through narrative content. The front-loaded processing model calculates all outcomes when segments begin, allowing for predictable client experiences. The distributed Lambda architecture with SQS queuing provides scalability and fault tolerance, while the comprehensive history tracking enables analytics and debugging. The system prioritizes player experience by gracefully handling failures and providing automatic recovery mechanisms.

### Recovery and Fault Tolerance

The system provides automatic recovery through multiple mechanisms:

- EventBridge ensures processing continues even if individual Lambda invocations fail
- Server-side state authority eliminates client synchronization issues
- Multiple cleanup paths prevent players from getting permanently stuck
- All segments guaranteed to eventually process or timeout with player-favorable outcomes
