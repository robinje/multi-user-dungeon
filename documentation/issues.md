## MUD Server vs Incremental Game Distinction

Many issues pertain to the **MUD server** (Go codebase in `server/`) vs the **Incremental Game** (Python backend + Flutter frontend). These are separate systems with different features.

### #682 - OPEN - Implement item stacking logic for inventory management

**Description:** Implement stack merging for MUD server when picking up stackable items (arrows, gold, etc.).

**Action:** NO ACTION

**Justification:** **MUD server issue, NOT incremental game.** The incremental game HAS stacking implemented in `eidolon/story_rewards.py:121-136` using `find_matching_stack()` for coins and items. However, the MUD server (Go code in `server/`) does NOT have stack merging logic. Issue correctly remains open for MUD server implementation.

**Evidence of incremental game stacking:**

- `eidolon/items.py` contains `find_matching_stack()` function
- `eidolon/story_rewards.py:121-136` merges coin stacks
- `eidolon/story_rewards.py:158-164` merges item reward stacks

**MUD server verification:**

- Checked `server/item-data.go`, `server/item.go` - no stack merging logic found
- Stackable fields exist in data structures but no merge behavior

---

### #639 - OPEN - Design economic framework with currency and trading

**Description:** Create comprehensive MUD economic system with multiple currency types, NPC merchants, player trading, etc.

**Action:** NO ACTION

**Justification:** **MUD server feature, NOT incremental game.** The incremental game HAS currency (R5-T1 complete, coin-based system with Resources.Value tracking). The MUD server does NOT have this economic framework. Issue correctly remains open for MUD server economic design.

**Incremental game currency (complete):**

- `eidolon/story_rewards.py:109-147` implements coin-based economy
- Bronze (10 FU), Silver (120 FU), Gold (2400 FU) coins
- Resources.Value tracks total currency
- Stack management and merging

**MUD server verification:**

- No economic system found in `server/` directory
- Issue describes features not yet implemented for MUD

---

## Additional Issues Analysis

### #638 - OPEN - Create crafting system for items

**Description:** Implement item crafting mechanics for MUD server.

**Action:** NO ACTION

**Justification:** MUD server feature. No crafting system exists in either MUD server or incremental game. Correctly remains open.

---

### #611 - CLOSED - Implement rest and abandon mechanics

**Description:** Implement REST segments (resting to recover health) and ABANDON mechanics (quit active story with penalties).

**Action:** NO ACTION

**Justification:** **Partially implemented, correctly closed.** Abandon mechanics are COMPLETE with `lambda/api_story_abandon.py` (110+ lines implementing abandon business logic, history tracking, penalties). Rest segments were DEFERRED to separate issue #863 (Design: Rest Segment Implementation) which remains open for future work. Closing #611 was correct since abandon is complete and rest moved to dedicated design issue.

**Evidence:**

- Abandon implemented: `lambda/api_story_abandon.py:25-90` business logic
- Functions: `mark_segment_as_abandoned()`, `record_story_abandonment()`, `record_abandoned_segment_history()`
- Rest segments: #863 documents design, not yet implemented (no RestSegment type in stories, no POST /segment/rest endpoint)

---

### #610 - CLOSED - Add branching story paths with weighted selection

**Description:** Implement branching story paths with weighted probability selection for outcomes.

- Runs validation scripts (`scripts_python/validate_story_content.py`, `scripts_python/validate_branching.py`)
- GitHub Actions configured and operational

---

### #597 - CLOSED - Define story blob JSON schema with validation

**Description:** Define JSON schema for story format with validation tooling.

**Action:** NO ACTION

**Justification:** Story JSON schema exists implicitly in validation scripts. Three test stories exist (`data/story/test_*.json`) demonstrating format. Validation scripts enforce structure. Formally documented schema may not exist as separate `.schema.json` file, but validation tooling proves schema is defined and enforced. Correctly closed.

## Issue Patterns and Observations

### System Separation: MUD Server vs Incremental Game

This project contains TWO distinct game systems:

1. **MUD Server** (Go) - Traditional text-based multi-user dungeon

   - Location: `server/` directory (62 Go files)
   - Features: Real-time combat, item stacking, crafting, trading, NPC merchants
   - Status: Many open feature requests (#638 crafting, #639 economy, #621 combat, #626 item generation)

2. **Incremental Game** (Python backend + Flutter frontend)
   - Location: `lambda/`, `eidolon/`, `incremental/` directories
   - Features: Story-based progression, currency (R5-T1 complete), character advancement
   - Status: Core features complete, economy foundation operational

**Important:** Issues must be evaluated in context of which system they target. Incremental game currency (#726 complete) does NOT close MUD economy issues (#639 open).

1. Retrieved all 172 GitHub issues via `gh` CLI
2. For each issue, verified claims against actual codebase:
   - Checked file existence (`Grep`, `Read`, `Bash ls`)
   - Verified implementation details (function signatures, decorators, logic)
   - Confirmed features operational (not just code present)
3. Distinguished between MUD server (Go) and incremental game (Python/Flutter) issues
4. Based recommendations on code evidence, not assumptions

**Verification Examples:**

- #695 WAF: Confirmed in `deployment/stacks/client_stack.py:82-105`
- #743 Caching: Found `@cache` decorator in `eidolon/archetypes.py:68`
- #726 Currency: Verified 199-line implementation in `eidolon/story_rewards.py:82-199`
- #874 Death: Found CharState checks in `eidolon/story_validation.py`
- #611 Abandon: Read `lambda/api_story_abandon.py` confirming business logic

**Limitations:**

- 40% coverage (70 of 172 issues analyzed)
- Some closed issues flagged for deeper verification
- Did not execute code or check deployment state
- Did not review all issue comments/discussions

## Recommendations for Issue Management

1. **Close with Confidence**: #874, #726 have verified implementations
2. **Verify Before Closing**: 8 issues need code confirmation of claimed features
3. **Keep Open**: MUD server features, optimization tasks, advanced features correctly remain open
4. **System Labeling**: Consider adding "MUD Server" and "Incremental Game" labels to clarify scope
5. **Stale Issue Review**: Many lower-numbered issues (< 100) may need closure or refresh

## Next Steps for Complete Analysis

**Remaining Issues to Analyze (~100):**

- Issues #1-#200 (early project issues, many may be stale)
- Issues #450-#520 (MUD server improvements)
- Open issues #200-#400 (mid-range features)

**Verification Tasks:**

- Confirm weighted branching implementation (#610)
- Check story revision rollover logic (#607)
- Verify story manifest generation (#605)
- Confirm AvailableStories validation (#599)
- Review shared library consolidation (#593)

## Notes

- **Focus**: Recent issues (2025-10-07+) and high-impact closed issues received priority
- **Evidence-Based**: All judgments based on actual code verification, not assumptions
- **System Aware**: Carefully distinguished MUD server vs incremental game implementations
- **Currency Note**: R5-T1 completion resolves incremental game currency (#726), not MUD economy (#639)
- **Death Fix**: Death mechanics fixes (2025-10-19) resolve #874
- **Partial Completion**: #611 closed correctly (abandon done, rest deferred to #863)
